            <h1>Hiragana Alphabet</h1>
            <p>
                The Japanese hiragana alphabet is the phonetic alphabet for Japanese. It contains all the sounds that are present in Japanese. There are a total of 46 characters with a few rules that modify some of the sounds. However, this page will contain the basic sounds found in Japanese
                Hiragana characters will appear alongside the other two Japanese alphabets, katakana and kanji. Hiragana characters also make up the backbone of kanji sounds. If you don't know how to write a specific kanji, you can write that kanji in hiragan characters.
            </p>

            <h2>Pronunciation Guide</h2>
            <p>
                Japanese is a fairly easy language to pronounce. However, there are a few caveats.
                The vowels of Japanese are pronounced the same as all other characters. The "A" sound is pronounced as the A in "law."
                The "I" is pronuced like the EE's in "see."
                The "U" is prnounced as the OU in "you."
                The "E" is pronunced as the E in "set."
                The "O" is pronounced as the O in "yo."
                Japanese consonants are pronounced the same as English consonants. Though, there is one exception, which is the Japanese "R" sound.
                In Japanese, the "R" sound is pronounced by placing the tip of the tongue behind the front teeth, curving the tongue, and pronouncing the R. It will sound kind of like a D, but there is a noticable difference.
                The last exception is the character を, "WO." It is pronunced exactly like the other Japanese "O" sound. The "W" is silent.
