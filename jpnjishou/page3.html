                        <p>
                        Kanji are Chinese characters that were originally borrowed from Chinese to represent the Japanese language because it had no written counterpart.
                        Japanese has adapted the characters, which has resulted in the birth of the hiragana and katakana alphabets for Japanese.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        A unique component from Japanese kanji is, they have two types of readings.
                        Onyomi, the Chinese reading for the kanji and kunyomi, the Japanese reading for the kanji. All readings are used for specific contexts that you learn as you read and study the language.
                        </p>
                        <p>There are about 2132 kanji that are required to learn to be fluent in Japanese. Sadly, though if you want to improve your fluency further, you need to learn about 1000 more kanji for names.
                        There are thousands of more kanji, but majority of those have fallen out of use and are archaic. Kanji are composed of radicals, which make up the a single kanji. The radicals can be a hint to the meaning or how to pronounce the kanji.
                        This aspect is difficult to learn because the meanings are based off of older meanings that don't make sense to modern day speakers.
                        </p>
                        <p>Another unique aspect of kanji is they can be interpreted without knowing how to say them.
                        All kanji have a meaning associated with them, so it becomes easier to read Japanese if you learn those meanings. The reverse is also true. You can know how to pronounce kanji without knowing the meaning too.
                        Words that are composed from kanji also become easy to figure out if you know the meanings. For each kanji in a word you can do an addition problem to determine the meaning of the kanji.
